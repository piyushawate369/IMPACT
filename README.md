# 🌍 Impact for Sustainability

> "The planet doesn’t need a few people doing sustainability perfectly —  
> it needs millions doing it imperfectly, but together."

### What is this?

Impact for Sustainability isn’t just another app.  
It’s where **Instagram meets purpose**, where likes turn into **action**, and where scrolling becomes **impact**.

This project was born out of a question that kept haunting us:

> “Why is it so easy to post a selfie, but so hard to plant a tree?”

So, we built a platform that rewards people for doing good — for cleaning beaches, planting trees, organizing drives, and living consciously.  
Every photo you post here is not just content… it’s a contribution.

### The Idea 💡

We live in a world where people want to act, but don’t know *how to start*.  
Our platform changes that by doing three simple things:

1. **Make sustainability social** — share your eco-actions like posts.  
2. **Make it rewarding** — earn points, badges, and leaderboard ranks.  
3. **Make it viral** — connect with change-makers and inspire others.

What started as a late-night conversation among Family members turned into a working platform — now with **289+ real users** taking real action.

### The Stack ⚙️

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript  
- **Database:** Supabase   
- **Hosting:** Hostinger
